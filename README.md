# Video Game Analysis with SQL

This project conducts analysis on video game data, emphasizing user scores, developers, geners and release years. The dataset used in this analysis contains information about various video games, including user ratings, developers, release years, and other relevant details.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to gain insights into the video game industry by performing SQL-based analyses on user scores, developers, and release years. By querying the dataset, we aim to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that can provide valuable information for game developers, publishers, and enthusiasts.
